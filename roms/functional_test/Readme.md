This is a binary containing a comprehensive set of tests for 6502 opcodes.

I use an adapted version for ca65 assembler from this repository https://github.com/amb5l/6502_65C02_functional_tests/tree/master/ca65

The binary here is compiled with default configuration except for the decimal mode - it's disabled as I haven't implemented it, see `.ca65` file.

See the `assembler` directory if you want to recompile with a different configuration
